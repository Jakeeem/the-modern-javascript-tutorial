1. What is JavaScript?
JavaScript's job is to bring websites to life using programs called 'scripts' that can  be written right in a web page's HTML and run automatically as the page loads.

These scripts are executed as plain text in the browser via a JS VM:
	- V8 (Chrome, Opera, Chromium)
	- SpiderMonkey (FireFox)
	- JavaScriptCore (Safari)
